        <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
        <p>I've spent the last five years really immersed in the people side of business, and honestly, it's become my passion. I actually started with a bachelor's in Sociology because I was fascinated by how people interact within systems and organizations. Later, I went back for my MBA to add that business strategy lens, and the combination has been incredibly valuable in how I approach organizational challenges.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my career, I've gotten my hands dirty with succession planning and performance management systems, really building those from scratch in a couple of cases. What I love most is diving into the data. I know that might sound odd, but I genuinely get excited about finding patterns in people analytics and translating those insights into strategies that actually move the needle. I've used tools like NVivo for qualitative data analysis, which has been a game changer when it comes to understanding employee feedback and sentiment at scale. I've presented to leadership teams more times than I can count, turning complex workforce data into clear stories that drive decision making.</p>
        
        <p>I've done most of this work in tech and SaaS companies, which I absolutely thrive in. There's something about that fast paced, high growth environment that brings out the best in me. You have to be comfortable with ambiguity and ready to pivot quickly. I'm completely fluent in English and pretty solid in Spanish, which has really helped working with our global teams.</p>
        
        <p>When it comes to tools, I'm very comfortable with the entire Microsoft Office Suite, but I've also built training materials and communications using Adobe Creative Suite and Camtasia for video content. Being able to create visually compelling presentations or quick tutorial videos has been surprisingly useful in driving adoption of new programs.</p>
        
        <p>But what I think really sets me apart is that I'm a builder at heart. I don't just want to maintain systems; I want to create them, improve them, make them better. I love that moment when you design a process and see it actually work across the organization.</p>
        
        <p>Right now, I'm actively looking for a full time opportunity to join a team, which is a shift for me. I've been consulting for the past couple of years, and while I've loved the variety and the challenge of parachuting into different organizations, I'm really craving that deeper connection. When you're consulting, you build something and then you hand it off, but you don't always get to see it evolve or refine it based on how people actually use it. I want to be embedded in one culture, really understand the nuances of one business, and be there for the long haul to see the impact of what we build together. There's something special about being part of a team where you can build those lasting relationships and truly become a trusted partner.</p>
        
        <p>I've been told I'm a strong strategic thinker, but I never lose sight of the details because both matter equally to me. And I think my real strength is in how I work with people. I've built partnerships across every level and every region, and I think it's because I genuinely listen and try to understand what different teams need. Leading change can be tough, but I've found that when you bring people along with you and create real collaboration, amazing things happen.</p>
